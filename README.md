# voiceControl-Verzeo
Voice controlled arduino car...... 

This project describes the implementation of a voice-controlled robotic car using Arduino. In this project, the user gives specific voice commands to the robot through an Android app installed on the smartphone. At the receiving side, a Bluetooth transceiver module receives the commands and forwards them to the Arduino on the robotic car.

Arduino controls the movements of the robot according to received commands. The robot moves forwards, backwards, left and right, and stops according to the voice commands forward, backward, left, right and stop, respectively.
